How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Its confusing at first because you don't know what to look at 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

By knowing the entire history of a file you are able to look at past errors and learn from them and also use that as reference for when someone you know has the same problem

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-You have a description of what was done in the commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-So that you keep track of all the files at once

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-You can use git log to view previous files and git diff to see what changes were made on commits 
you may have questions on

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-I could use git log to see the different commits and then git diff to see how the bug was introduced by
comparing the current committ with the commit previous to that one

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
-Keep track of future projects
